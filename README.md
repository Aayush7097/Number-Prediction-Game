🎮 Number Prediction Game

A simple Java-based console game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.
The game provides hints after each guess (Too high, Too low, Correct!) and tracks the number of attempts.

This project is designed as a beginner-friendly Java application, focusing on user input handling, random number generation, conditional logic, and loops.

📌 Features

✅ Random number generation within a range

✅ User input handling via console (Scanner)

✅ Feedback messages: Too high, Too low, Correct!

✅ Attempt counter (tracks number of guesses)

✅ Maximum attempt limit (default: 5 tries)

✅ Difficulty levels:

Easy → 1–50

Medium → 1–100

Hard → 1–200

✅ Score system: Best score (fewest attempts) is tracked across games

✅ Play again option (restart without exiting program)
